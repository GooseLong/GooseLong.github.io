# GMTK Game Jam 2020
Github repo for code to go in. :)

## THEME : Out of Control

Current idea: Anxiety in space
 - Visual Novel
 - Space Station modern day style but with some aliens and robots thrown in for fun
 - You have just arrived
 - Characters approach you to introduce themselves
 - If things become too sevre/stressful your social anxiety takes over and you automatically pick dialogue options 


## TODOs:
 1. Title screen / menu / credits in JS
 2. Adding assets and fixing the bugs that arrise when I do
 3. Fixing up UI
 4. Write dialogue
 5. Stitch story together into satisfying narrative
