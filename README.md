## THEME : Out of Control

Current idea: Anxiety in space
 - Visual Novel
 - Space Station modern day style but with some aliens and robots thrown in for fun
 - You have just arrived
 - Characters approach you to introduce themselves
 - If things become too sevre/stressful your social anxiety takes over and you automatically pick dialogue options 
 - Rival type character arrives at the space station with you
 - You give your rival the first pick of bunk


## Story Structure
1. Talk to rival while docking
2. Talk to 1/3 character
3. Talk to rival again
4. Talk to 2/3 character
5. Talk to rival a third time
6. Talk to 3/3 character
7. Let rival pick bunk buddy first
8. Pick your bunk buddy
9. Breif chat with your bunk buddy
10. End
